/*There are 3 variables: 
 * a. Local Variables: created inside a method (in main method or in any other methods)
 * 		- You have to initialize the variable ==> assigning a value.
 * 			If you do not assign, Java complains. 
 * 
 * b. Instant (Object) Variables: inside classes but outside methods and without "static" keyword.
 * 	- no necessary to initialize - optional.
 *  - Java will use defaults
 *  - They are attached to every object. 
 *  
 * c. Class Variables
 * 	- They are "static" variables outside the methods inside the class.
 * 	- Class variable is created once and this variable can be used in every object if desired
 * 	which means they are attached to the class.
 * - initialize is optional.
